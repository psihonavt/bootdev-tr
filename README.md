# Bootdev CLI Total Recall Edition

Fork of the official command line tool for [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) with a new quiz mode. 

## Why?
It is a project for the Bootdev 2025 Hackathon event. 

Smart people say that to solidify something in your memory, you need to access freshly learned facts and concepts several times at certain intervals. While Bootdev offers quality courses, everything you learn there will be forgotten sooner or later. 

Of course, practice makes perfect, and the best solution is to apply the knowledge to something practical (like programming actual stuff). But that's not always an option. I figured it'd be nice to have a way to rehash some of the information you learned (or you think you learned) whenever you feel like it. This little project is also my first try at vibe coding with the claude CLI tool. 


## How?
I decided to reuse the existing CLI tool. At first, I envisioned a web page, but as an old backend [grug brain developer](https://grugbrain.dev/), I promptly decided not to ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

I extended the client with new API calls and added new CLI commands. It stores questions and answers in the local SQLite database. I also entertained myself by designing a simple UI for an active quiz using the bubbletea package. Claude CLI actually really helped me figure out how to work with bubbletea. "To figure out" == most of the UI-related code was generated by Claude, that is. I do like TUIs. 

With the new `quiz` command you can now do quizzes on completed courses. The tool will generate quiz questions for you based on the lessons' content using Claude LLM. There is an option to run a "mock" quiz on any course in case you don't want to bother with using a real key (and it should bother you big time to give an API key to a random GitHub project). 

## Installation

# Afterword 
I had a lot of fun working on this little project. I even started liking Golang. What a neat language.

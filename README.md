# Bootdev CLI Total Recall Edition

Fork of the official command line tool for [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) with a new quiz mode. 

## Why?
This is a project for the Bootdev 2025 Hackathon event.

Smart people say that to solidify something in your memory, you need to access freshly learned facts and concepts several times at specific intervals. While Bootdev offers quality courses, everything you learn there will eventually be forgotten.

Of course, practice makes perfect, and the best solution is to apply knowledge to something practical (like programming actual stuff). But that's not always an option. I figured it'd be nice to have a way to review information you learned (or think you learned) whenever you feel like it. This little project is also my first attempt at vibe coding with the Claude CLI tool.

## How?
I decided to reuse the existing CLI tool. At first, I envisioned a web page, but as an old backend [grug brain developer](https://grugbrain.dev/), I promptly decided against it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I extended the client with new API calls and added new CLI commands. It stores questions and answers in a local SQLite database. I also entertained myself by designing a simple UI for active quizzes using the bubbletea package. The Claude CLI actually helped me figure out how to work with bubbletea. "To figure out" meaning most of the UI-related code was generated by Claude. I do like TUIs.

With the new quiz command, you can now take quizzes on completed courses. The tool generates quiz questions for you based on lesson content using Claude LLM. There's an option to run a "mock" quiz on any course in case you don't want to provide a real API key (and it should bother you to give an API key to a random GitHub project).

## Installation
Please refer to the official README: https://github.com/bootdotdev/bootdev

# Afterword 
I had a lot of fun working on this little project. I even started liking Golang. What a neat language.
